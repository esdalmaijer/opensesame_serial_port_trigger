1. About
--------

In EEG studies it is common to send triggers to mark the time of significant events (e.g., the onset of a trial, presentation of a particular stimulus, etc.). Triggers are typically bytes that can be sent via the parallel and serial ports on the stimulus computer to the EEG apparatus. This plug-in allows you to easily send triggers via the serial port. For the Parallel Port plug-in by Bob Rosbag, please see [here](https://github.com/dev-jam/opensesame_plugin_parallel-port-trigger).

2. Installation
---------------

Download this plug-in, by clicking the 'Download ZIP' button (should be in the menu on the right). Next, unzip the archive that you've just downloaded. After unzipping, you can copy the folder 'serial_port_trigger' to the 'plugins' folder of your OpenSesame installation.
